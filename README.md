Greetings,

It seems like you stumbled upon my profile, perchance you take a moment to read this?
I am an amateur "Jack of all Trades" from Germany. I have been coding for about one year now
not consistently more so off and on. If you are wondering about my profile picture, yes I drew that myself
for, I am an artist. I am fluent in my Mother tongue german as well as English.
